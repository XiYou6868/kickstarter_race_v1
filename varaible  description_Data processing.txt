Filter the data for ended projects with an end date between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2022 within 'Technology', 'Design’ ‘Game’Category.
1.Non converted USD version:"kickstarter_cleaned_fullversion_v3.xlsx" for the original USD In’Pledged’ and ‘Goal’ dataset in Feature Engineering-V3.ipynb.From 87805 to 54978.
The kickstarter_cleaned_fullversion_v3.xlsx consists of detailed records spanning various aspects of Kickstarter projects that the non-dollars convert to nan.
Initially, the dataset comprised 87,805 entries across 41 diverse columns, encompassing information such as project identifiers, state, financial goals, creator details, and engagement metrics.
We filtered projects to only include those with an end date between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2022 and specifically be 'Technology', 'Design’ ‘Game’Category.
This allows us to focus on recent projects and trends.
Project State: We included only projects classified as 'successful' or 'failed', facilitating a binary classification approach. The 'State' column was converted to a boolean value for simplicity, with 'successful' mapped to True and 'failed' mapped to False. This transformation simplifies the dataset and tailors it for binary logistic analysis.
Post initial deduplication (the feature except 'ProjectID', 'URL', and 'CreatorURL'), the dataset remained with 55,638 unique projects. A secondary round of deduplication was executed excluding attributes deemed non-critical for duplication assessment ('Text', 'backed', 'create', 'TotalCreated', 'TotalBacked'). This additional deduplication step brought the project entries down to 54,978. This further deduplication (continue to exclude attributes ‘Subcategories’ and ‘Category’) the number of entries is still 54978.
Columns deemed non-essential for the impending analysis ('Text', 'backed', 'create', 'TotalCreated', and 'TotalBacked') were removed. This step was taken to declutter the dataset and focus on the most impactful variables.
Filtered Dataset Characteristics: Post-filtering and cleaning, the dataset was condensed to 54,978 unique entries, maintaining the integrity of the original 36 columns but now streamlined to focus on relevant and distinct projects fitting the study criteria.The cleaned dataset was saved as 'kickstarter_filtered_v3.xlsx'. 

2.Converted to USD version:"kickstarter_cleaned_fullversion_usd_v3.xlsx" for the USD-converted dataset In’Pledged’ and ‘Goal’ in Feature Engineering-V3 usd.ipynb.From 89013 to 56638.
For the"kickstarter_cleaned_fullversion_usd_v3.xlsx", originally, there were 89,013 entries. After these same filtering and cleaning processes , it was reduced from its original 89,013 entries to 56,638 unique entries. This filtered dataset contains cleaned and relevant information ready for deeper analysis and modeling.
The final cleaned and filtered dataset for the USD version was then saved as 'kickstarter_filtered_usd_v3.xlsx'.
